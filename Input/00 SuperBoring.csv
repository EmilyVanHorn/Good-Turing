All of these content have to potential of increasing sales for the restaurant and also encourage customers to try out new dishes that they might not know of. For the ads the restaurant can sell ad space to certain selected partners like cookware maker, appliance makers, other restaurants not in direct competition, entertainment like movie theaters and local festivals. Customers could also order their food through an interactive menu right on the table cloth. This would eliminate the wait time and ensure the customers receive their food faster.

5Ka4yMLK4qy7PwTBn,"Many reseteraunts have kids menus for children to keep them entertained while waiting for the food. Other reseteraunts have even expanded upon this concept of entertainment while waiting and introduced tablets or stationary table set electronics systems wtth games and trivia on them so adults can enjoy it too. I believe this invention or ""fabric display"" could now take this interactive experience one step further and with a proper tablecloth, turn the entire table top into an interactive display for the family to enjoy. There could be games for children, trivia for the whole family, interactive coloring books, etc. In fact, it doesn't have to stop there and be just about games. You could display the menus directly on the table, have video entertainment available for families that do not wish to play games or do not have children with them so they can watch television, youtube type videos or watch movies while waiting. Take it even further! - Display readable books so that guests by themselves can read a book while waiting, have visual displays that go along with music to keep people entertained, turn the table into a passive part of the art decor by just changing the look of it - it doesn't have to be interactive. A seafood resteraunt with tables that look like flowing water or crab pots, a family resteraunt wihere after the food arrives and games are done the table can be set to be pokemon themed, or ninja turtle themed, whatever it is the resteraunt wants to offer and the family/patrons choose.

It would work as a place mat or light for the table. Once the guests arrives, the menu should be displayed for ordering. The guests should be able to see all the menus and specials. After the order is done. the adults could view the history and waiter/waitress info. The kids should have an option to color or draw on the fabric. This will keep them busy. In addition to the history, the adults should be able to explore activities within the city and some advertising deals. When the food arrives, the fabric display could be used as a place mat warmer or cooler.to keep the food at a good temp.
