While they would remain at school on each desk it could be a personal account you log into from any system. It would have to auto log people at the end of each class.

Other reseteraunts have even expanded upon this concept of entertainment while waiting and introduced tablets or stationary table set electronics systems wtth games and trivia on them so adults can enjoy it too. I believe this invention or ""fabric display"" could now take this interactive experience one step further and with a proper tablecloth, turn the entire table top into an interactive display for the family to enjoy. There could be games for children, trivia for the whole family, interactive coloring books, etc. In fact, it doesn't have to stop there and be just about games. You could display the menus directly on the table, have video entertainment available for families that do not wish to play games or do not have children with them so they can watch television, youtube type videos or watch movies while waiting. Take it even further! - Display readable books so that guests by themselves can read a book while waiting, have visual displays that go along with music to keep people entertained, turn the table into a passive part of the art decor by just changing the look of it - it doesn't have to be interactive. A seafood resteraunt with tables that look like flowing water or crab pots, a family resteraunt wihere after the food arrives and games are done the table can be set to be pokemon themed, or ninja turtle themed, whatever it is the resteraunt wants to offer and the family/patrons choose.

RjDufrHWP9EB4jtL6,"I'm pretty anti-social, an introvert to the core. So I would love the ability to ""order"" from a real person without really having to interact with them. Inevitably, something goes wrong and the computer crashes and I have to stand around waiting for someone to come fix it so I can leave. If the person themselves become the interactive menu, then ""tech support"" is right there! That way I can order my food with or without making eye contact! The choice is mine! And if/when I end up with technology problems, I can simply ask the person whose clothing I'm using!",AEKOPV99Z7L85,1463631967640,restaurants,,waiter
