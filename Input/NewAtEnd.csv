Other reseteraunts have even expanded upon this concept of entertainment while waiting and introduced tablets or stationary table set electronics systems wtth games and trivia on them so adults can enjoy it too. I believe this invention or ""fabric display"" could now take this interactive experience one step further and with a proper tablecloth, turn the entire table top into an interactive display for the family to enjoy. There could be games for children, trivia for the whole family, interactive coloring books, etc. In fact, it doesn't have to stop there and be just about games. You could display the menus directly on the table, have video entertainment available for families that do not wish to play games or do not have children with them so they can watch television, youtube type videos or watch movies while waiting. Take it even further! - Display readable books so that guests by themselves can read a book while waiting, have visual displays that go along with music to keep people entertained, turn the table into a passive part of the art decor by just changing the look of it - it doesn't have to be interactive. A seafood resteraunt with tables that look like flowing water or crab pots, a family resteraunt wihere after the food arrives and games are done the table can be set to be pokemon themed, or ninja turtle themed, whatever it is the resteraunt wants to offer and the family/patrons choose.

eoKHzAaYXWyEpRh6H,"I like the idea of having these on each desk at school the best. I think that it could attach to the table and allow kids to see a copy of the board up close to them and it could be intractable so they could highlight key parts or in math maybe try to solve along with the teacher. There could be a button that allows them to send the teacher a question in private. it could have the ability to record parts of the lesson in either audio or visual formats and could screen shot things like home work or even just have it auto saved in a file so you never forget what it was you had to do again. While they would remain at school on each desk it could be a personal account you log into from any system. It would have to auto log people at the end of each class. You would have a special pen to write on it with, would save so many trees and normal pens. It would have no gaming or chatting (outside of with the teacher). Well, maybe limited chatting for group work.",ABO9F0JD9NN54,1462287526940,restaurants,new*,education
