mgr6CdGCxbQxnkRxP,"I believe it could be really fun for the artist to be able to kind of set up ""pre-made"" pieces of art that they would generally draw; then people could come up to this piece of cloth at an exhibit that the person is holding and they could select a ""piece"" from the person's pre-set collection. Then once that item is selected they could place it on the canvas. Basically the artist would be able to show off a large array of smaller pieces of his art while also allowing an audience to interactively participate with the art. And if possible the artist could have the tablet or computer with the items nearby and if they were more of an electronic artist then if someone wanted them to create something on the spot they could. This could be a fun way for an up and coming artist to show off their skill on the spot, plus they could have a memorable piece of art that they could remember their event by which could be super awesome to have as a mosaic. And assuming that the image is save-able in some way then the artist could possibly print it out and even sell prints of the ""mosaic"" of his own art as a piece of memorabilia or even as a collectible. The artist could even allow the touch sensing to allow people to change colors of the pieces he's included, basically the artist could choose to have a large set of ""black and white"" images which the people could then select from, add to the canvas, and color in however they chose which could be a lot of fun for people especially with the new big push of adult coloring books. I believe that this is an interesting idea just because it could give a smaller artist a really fun way to connect with patrons at an art exhibit and possibly even show off their abilities by being able to possibly add art on request. The only issue that many might have with this is that they might feel it would detract from the work they actually want people to be paying attention to so this could possibly be a post- or pre- show event that people could participate in.",A129B5FAMFJNAT,1463634072620,visualArts,15,artist
AwEKeXE2my8w2r7ur,"So one way for artists to be able to best interact with people, or to at least generate interest is to have a way for people to ask for a specific drawing or style. By allowing people to sort of request their own using the touch fabric, rather than just write something down, it helps create an interaction between the artist and the requester. It can also allow them to possibly roughly sketch something out easily without having to give them pen / paper so that the artist can somewhat see a visual representation of what they are looking for. The artist can then interact with their self made drawing or request and quickly sketch it out or adjust the drawing to help give them an idea of what the finalized product might look like. This would even allow the artist to easily mess with some of the basic colors in front of the requester to ensure that the color schemes match and make sure that the requester is as happy as possible. The whole idea revolves around providing the artist with the flexibility they need, without the hassle of having to carry around pens, pencils, paint, paper etc. and still be able to accommodate someone's request.",AFXE92S04IYHY,1463639679250,visualArts,16,artist
