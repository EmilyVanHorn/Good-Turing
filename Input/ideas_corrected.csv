mgr6CdGCxbQxnkRxP,"I believe it could be really fun for the artist to be able to kind of set up ""pre-made"" pieces of art that they would generally draw; then people could come up to this piece of cloth at an exhibit that the person is holding and they could select a ""piece"" from the person's pre-set collection. Then once that item is selected they could place it on the canvas. Basically the artist would be able to show off a large array of smaller pieces of his art while also allowing an audience to interactively participate with the art. And if possible the artist could have the tablet or computer with the items nearby and if they were more of an electronic artist then if someone wanted them to create something on the spot they could. This could be a fun way for an up and coming artist to show off their skill on the spot, plus they could have a memorable piece of art that they could remember their event by which could be super awesome to have as a mosaic. And assuming that the image is save-able in some way then the artist could possibly print it out and even sell prints of the ""mosaic"" of his own art as a piece of memorabilia or even as a collectible. The artist could even allow the touch sensing to allow people to change colors of the pieces he's included, basically the artist could choose to have a large set of ""black and white"" images which the people could then select from, add to the canvas, and color in however they chose which could be a lot of fun for people especially with the new big push of adult coloring books. I believe that this is an interesting idea just because it could give a smaller artist a really fun way to connect with patrons at an art exhibit and possibly even show off their abilities by being able to possibly add art on request. The only issue that many might have with this is that they might feel it would detract from the work they actually want people to be paying attention to so this could possibly be a post- or pre- show event that people could participate in.",A129B5FAMFJNAT,1463634072620,visualArts

By allowing people to sort of request their own using the touch fabric, rather than just write something down, it helps create an interaction between the artist and the requester. It can also allow them to possibly roughly sketch something out easily without having to give them pen / paper so that the artist can somewhat see a visual representation of what they are looking for. The artist can then interact with their self made drawing or request and quickly sketch it out or adjust the drawing to help give them an idea of what the finalized product might look like. This would even allow the artist to easily mess with some of the basic colors in front of the requester to ensure that the color schemes match and make sure that the requester is as happy as possible. The whole idea revolves around providing the artist with the flexibility they need, without the hassle of having to carry around pens, pencils, paint, paper etc. and still be able to accommodate someone's request.",AFXE92S04IYHY,1463639679250,visualArts

It would be very useful in places where it is hard for security to hear exactly what's going on (such as an airport, sporting event, concert) and they would be able to see the display. It would also be used to indicate what type of emergency or assistance would be required, for instance if you are standing by the side of the road you could have the display state that you are in need of a jump or that someone in the vehicle is having a medical emergency. For children, having remote access to this through a smartphone could mark the child as lost, as well as be a hidden ""gps"" system to reduce amber alerts.",A2HDMUBGXJSONQ,1463632829230,safety

KWMar6p29jHCWGkRZ,"I think I would work on developing an integrated ""mood ring"" technology that includes another wearable device that tracks measurables such as calories inputted/outputted, heart rate, hours slept, whether someone has exercised that day, and other such information. From there, the wearable device interprets this data through a mood formula, determining how a person is feeling at that moment. From there, the fabric display would communicate with the wearable and change the color of someone's shirt or pants to match their mood. This could also be accomplished by displaying an emoji like a badge on a person's shirt or shorts or wherever they want it. This would help others who struggle to read people to know how the person is feeling. This would also help the person with the wearable technology to be more honest in their communication with others. Hopefully, this would allow people to deepen their relationships with their friends and families. Maybe it wouldn't need to be worn all the time and could be used in support groups or in therapy. Therapists would truly benefit from gathering this information from their clients, as recall is notorious for being unreliable. Maybe this could even be used to keep people accountable when unlawful things happen - so they can say ""Well, you saw I was in a very very bad mood, why did you mess with me?""

I think something like this could take advertising to the next level. Imagine being able to advertise on the jersey's of basketball players. Or being able to set up advertisement on people themselves. You could even set up billboards in new and exciting ways then just putting them on top of buildings. You could set up poles around the city and wrap fabric with fabric display to show off advertisement on a much larger scale. You could set it up in buildings in creative ways. Not to mention if this technology grows it could even get into the television industry. This would pretty much replace the standard bulky televisions with something much simpler and easy to set up.

I believe this invention or ""fabric display"" could now take this interactive experience one step further and with a proper tablecloth, turn the entire table top into an interactive display for the family to enjoy. There could be games for children, trivia for the whole family, interactive coloring books, etc. In fact, it doesn't have to stop there and be just about games. You could display the menus directly on the table, have video entertainment available for families that do not wish to play games or do not have children with them so they can watch television, youtube type videos or watch movies while waiting. Take it even further! - Display readable books so that guests by themselves can read a book while waiting, have visual displays that go along with music to keep people entertained, turn the table into a passive part of the art decor by just changing the look of it - it doesn't have to be interactive. A seafood resteraunt with tables that look like flowing water or crab pots, a family resteraunt wihere after the food arrives and games are done the table can be set to be pokemon themed, or ninja turtle themed, whatever it is the resteraunt wants to offer and the family/patrons choose.

aBrrdqnxcG4LBP3y7,"I would definitely focus in on the meet-and-greet idea here, for single people. They could convey, in a succinct way, who they are and what they're looking for. It would make for an interesting conversation starter at the market or at parties. It could be tastefully done, of course -- but people would have the means to present themselves in the way they want, without limitations. They could give as much or as little information as they liked, and leave it up to others to ask questions. I really like this idea, and I can see it being instrumental in changing the face of dating, especially if the item worn was easily identifiable. Now, I'm not sure how people would take to it, but I think that extroverts would have a blast with it. Incorporating photos would give the item color and make it more interesting, displaying the wearer doing what he or she enjoys (travel, sports, other hobbies). The garment would come with templates that wearers could fill in themselves, or if they were more tech-savvy, they could DIY. The producer of the garment could use testimonials to market it, and, in fact, market it as a better way to meet new people. It could work for people seeking friends, baby sitters, personal assistants, looking for work, etc., too.

That way the person would be able to wake up immediately instead of having to live through their nightmare and then they have the opportunity to go back to sleep instead of suffering through that experience.

fFFN3tkwTP8P99EyE,A color changing curtain that slowly dims would be great. The curtains could work similar to the f.lux software in that they help you get acclimated to the room and calm you. As the night goes on they would have low visibility but would give off moonlight ambience. There could even be star twinkles on the curtains to give the appearance that you were outside camping under the sky. The curtains would be blackout curtains at night to filter out any outside light pollution. As it transitioned into morning with you asleep the curtains would slowly start to adjust to the light outside and start to give off light similar to sunlight. Even on rainy days you would wake up to a sunny window. The curtains would especially be helpful to people who have pets or children that fall asleep in their beds.

With augmented reality, the player has some sort of visual interface, like a phone camera, that they look at the world through. The interface responds to real world stimuli and produces the game based on these stimuli. If you lined an area with these fabric displays, you could use it as a play area for various augmented reality games. Ideally the interface would be some sort of glasses to give the player more utility with their hands. The fabric displays would serve as background and textures for the game giving the illusion of a fleshed out world that the player could interact with. This could bridge the gap between augmented reality and virtual reality. For example, Imagine laser-tag with an intense post apocalyptic war scene going on around the players.

It would help keep the audiences engaged, as well as give them a new experience. The fabric display can be used for so many different things in a live performance and can expand the way the show is to be performed. It would also help decrease the need for handmade scenes and props since all of it could be digitally projected. This would save the play money on building costs, as well as the materials that would've been used otherwise. The fabric can be displayed at events like music concerts by streaming colors, designs, or anything in the background, while things like school plays could project different environmental scenes.

dTsSpMYnBcdChqE9W,"The most useful idea I think this product has is to use as a mobile display for a warning system of sorts. This can be used for road hazards that can help show drivers what the hazard is. It can also be used to give directions to alternate routes. This system will be extremely simple to set up and very mobile so a large vehicle is not required to carry the equipment needed. This will allow multiple hazard warning signs to be placed with the same amount of work taht one normal sign would use while displaying much more information. This will allow drivers to not only know when they need to get over but can help slow people down with more signs. These signs can also be doubled as traffic time signs, showing upcoming traffic in the area someone is about to enter. This system will be simple but very effective in my opinion",A2P1VYBQ79Y92Q,1462796424350,liveEntertain

YfZAixbFRnP9C6mXX,"I think that visual displays at live shows and events is already quite common so I think that doing something to really make it stand out would be a good idea. By using the appropriate display content (the electronic information that is being displayed) to coordinate and coincide with physical movement of the fabric I think that the overall visual effect could be further enhanced. Perhaps by using some other device to move, wave, manipulate the fabric that is electronically linked to the fabric display device, the two could work in conjunction to create 3D like effects and really impress the viewers. I have seen a physics demonstration that shows amazing geometric standing wave formations on the surface of a drum head accomplished by using a frequency generator connected to a speaker. The effect is astonishing and by combining it with this visual display device I think you could achieve something truly unique and awesome.",A2WF8JGMNB4UEN,1463636439220,liveEntertain

Or if the song is exciting and it really gets your blood pumping it could show all kinds of crazy flashing lights and electricity because that's wacky. And this particular idea could be combined with the lyrics popping up idea, get people in the mood and have them contribute (if the performers want them too, if not, then this doesn't have to happen) by singing along or dancing a certain way or whatever is deemed appropriate at the time.

 The games would see and possibly with audio hear what was going on around them, so they could interact with the gaming world like the real world.
 
 The scenes would slide by on these panels as the scene or room changed. From dark rooms, to pristine forests. The level of realism and interaction could be endless. 
 
 The DM would create all of this content beforehand and then on the fly, as the players played they would change or alter things as the players interacted with the world. Decisions could be made and alter how things occur.",A28AL67SNA20JS,1462788363170,interiorDesign

Make it something to their specific liking. Whatever they feel like that day, we could change it for them. And then we could do the same idea for the sheets, like the fitted sheet. It could be a special design during the day. And at night, a portion of the fitted sheet could become like a night light. Maybe the feet part of the sheet could have a very soft glow, instead of always trying to make sure an outlet is in a good place for a night light. And the 'sheet' idea could definitely become fun in the parents room. It could really set the mood for their special nights!",APV0WJWTK3IP3,1462241395050,interiorDesign

Another potential variation of the game would be a team game, where teams are rapidly changing, which increases the fun of the game! This idea can be used in tag or paintball as well.

Maybe you could make an entire history classroom, and have every wall surface be covered in this material, so that the students could step into the classroom and be transported. I'm imagining that the teacher could have them enter this 'living history lab' and have it look just like a normal room, and then turn the lights off, and when they come back on, the kids would just be completely surrounded by the place they are studying. I am imagining that it could be cool for a botany class too, the kids could be transported to a jungle, underwater, high in the mountains - wherever! You could use POV video to make it seem as though they were actually navigating the place. you could make it interactive, and have them see a classroom somewhere else in the world, and have them talk with the kids that are there. Even the 'windows' could be made to resemble the outside of where the other class is. This would be cool for a 'virtual exchange.' You could actually have 2 classrooms, in 2 locations, both equipped with this, and let them interact with each other in this way.

WW5YJ4ivWaftdvy7p,My focus idea is to use this fabric to help educate students who do not have access to resources. This could be expanded to impoverished neighborhoods and even remote countries. This would make educating children so simple. You could present to them so much and knowledge using this fabric display without having to bring a lot of different supplies. The high resolution images/videos could be put together in advance as a comprehensive educational package. Then areas could be targeted. This could start in the United States. Targeting areas with low education scores and teaching the children there. Then this could be expanded to areas where education is not possible and children are not able to go to school. This could help them get excited about learning and education. This could also help to transport large amounts of information with only a fabric display. The images projected on the material would make learning more fun and exciting. This could be adapted in many different ways to help really enhance the educational experience of underprivileged children.,A2WC2NO555XU3J,1462293993130,education

If you connect them correctly, the outline will turn green, if not it will turn red. Students will learn not only anatomy structures, but the proper placement within the body. You could do this for all types of concepts such as atoms, the food chain. You could use small pieces to build molecules, two hydrogen pieces and one oxygen for water.

You can take them wherever, whenever, as long as you design the appropriate output, which we already do through movies and other media. But when you can lay out a large peice of fabric, or even a small portable one, to zoom in on various features, ferns, urns, whatever your heart desires! You could show them anything related to your subject, all in realtime. And we all know children are visual learners. I can't say how many ideas, just on this I have, because the possiblites are endless!

For example, let's say the graphic designer needs to create a logo for a local semi-pro baseball team. They need a logo that looks good both on the home jersey (white) and on their away jersey (let's say red). They could have a swatch of fabric in both colors to get the design exactly the way they want it against each fabric. Later, when they are making their pitch to the team for the logo, they can use this device to show team management how it would look without the hassle of actually have to print an actual mock-up. The more I think about this, the more I think it could be used for all sorts of fashion ideas. It would be a really inexpensive way to demonsrate a design without the time/expense of doing a mock-up.",A2NT8U7GSYGISJ,1463632246710,0

It'll be washable so after a trip with the kids in the fort to a place out of this world you can wash it. This can also be a great study tool. Pull up the solar system and sit underneath it in the sheet fort. Hands on learning and a breathtaking view of what the universe has to offer.
